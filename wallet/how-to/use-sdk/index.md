# Use MetaMask SDK

MetaMask SDK currently supports all JavaScript-based, native iOS, and Unity dapps.
It provides a reliable, secure, and seamless [connection](../../concepts/sdk-connections.md) from
your dapp to a MetaMask wallet client.

You can see instructions for using the SDK with the following platforms:

- JavaScript:
  - Web dapps:
    - [React](javascript/react.md)
    - [Pure JavaScript](javascript/pure-js.md)
    - [Other web frameworks](javascript/other-web-frameworks.md)
  - [React Native](javascript/react-native.md)
  - [Node.js](javascript/nodejs.md)
  - [Electron](javascript/electron.md)
- Mobile:
  - [React Native](javascript/react-native.md)
  - [native iOS](ios.md)
- Gaming:
  - [Unity](unity.md)

:::tip Coming soon
SDK support for Android and Unreal Engine is coming soon.

:::note
MetaMask SDK uses the [Ethereum provider](../../reference/provider-api.md) that developers are
already used to, so existing dapps work out of the box with the SDK.
